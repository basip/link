## Upgrading Link instances from v1.2.8 to v1.2.9

### Webrtc dialer support added

Webrtc dialer can be used if your application works via the https protocol(sip with web proxy) and the browser is allowed to use a microphone, camera and notifications.

In addition, you must use the latest [docker-compose.yaml](../with-sip/with-web-proxy/docker-compose.yml) configuration file.

### Thanks
